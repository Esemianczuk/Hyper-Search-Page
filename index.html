            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve been working on a side project called the "Hyper Search Engine," which helps me navigate my massive, unorganized JavaScript codebase (part of my cycling routing website, <a href="https://sherpa-map.com">Sherpa Map</a>). The goal is to create a semantic search engine that retrieves functions and variables based on vague recollections, bypassing traditional documentation (which I never really made). I developed a multi-step process that leverages GPT-4, Babel ASTs, T5 models, and vector embeddings for fast and intelligent code search.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step is parsing the code with Babel to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for every file. This allows deep analysis of the code, extracting scopes, functions, variables, and their relationships. After parsing, I use the GPT-4 API to generate summaries and keywords for each function and variable, which then becomes the training data for two fine-tuned T5 models.
            </p>
            <p>
                The T5 models are trained for two tasks: generating concise summaries and creating synonyms for function and variable names. These models were trained on an RTX 4090 using a sliding window approach to handle larger inputs. I implemented recursive summarization with forward and backward propagation to capture context throughout the function tree, ensuring a full-picture understanding of how each function fits into the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
                After generating the summaries and synonyms, I convert them into vector embeddings using MPNet and index them using FAISS for fast, semantic search. This lets me search my codebase with vague queries, and the engine returns relevant matches by comparing embeddings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built this tool to avoid writing traditional documentation, which often goes out of date. The Hyper Search Engine automates the process of documenting and understanding the codebase, making it easy to search for functions and variables based on how I remember them or based on their context within the code.
